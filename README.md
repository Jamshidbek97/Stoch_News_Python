# Stoch_News_Python
It is essential for an investor to keep himself updated about the markets in order to secure maximum advantage. Standard newspapers specializing in finance and investments are a good source and more than enough for long-term investors or people who are investing in the market as a stream of passive income. But, day traders have to know whatâ€™s happening around them on a real-time basis given the tough competitive environment.
I create this app using Python, (https://github.com/Jamshidbek97/Stoch_News_Python) I use twilio that helps user to send message to their phone when stock i changed.
I also use API's https://www.alphavantage.co/ for checking changes and https://newsapi.org/ for getting news about favorite company.
